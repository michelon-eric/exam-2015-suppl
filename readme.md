## very scuffed php 'framework'

I'm not a php developer... I use c... this is almost definitely useless \[redacted\]

I took a lot of inspiration from other frameworks but this is all my own code written by my hand

actually you know what this is going well I'm happy &lt;-- not in touch with the reality of the situation

#### libraries and shit

-   htmx
-   tailwind
-   preline
